# Sound Dropdown Implementation for Collection Notifications

## Summary

I have successfully implemented sound dropdown functionality for the Collection Notifications feature in NoobTacoUI-Media. This allows users to select custom sounds for each notification type and saves the settings globally (account-wide).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Sound Dropdown Component (`UIAssets.lua`)

Added two new UI utility functions:

- **`CreateSoundDropdown(parent, width, height, mediaType)`**: Creates a Nord-themed dropdown that integrates with LibSharedMedia to show all available sounds
- **`CreateSoundTestButton(parent, size)`**: Creates a play button for testing selected sounds

### 2. Enhanced Config Menu (`ConfigMenu.lua`)

Modified the Collection Notifications section to include:

- **Sound selection dropdowns** for each notification type (Pet, Mount, Toy, Transmog)
- **Test buttons** next to each dropdown for immediate sound preview
- **Automatic settings persistence** - changes are saved immediately to the global database
- **Default sound assignment** based on notification type:
  - Pets: "NT_InfussionOfLight" (magical theme)
  - Mounts: "NT_Mount" (mount-specific)
  - Toys & Transmog: "NT_Chest" (treasure theme)

### 3. Global Settings Storage

- Settings are stored in `NoobTacoDB.CollectionNotifications` 
- Database is marked as `SavedVariables` in the .toc file for account-wide persistence
- Sound settings are stored as: `soundPet`, `soundMount`, `soundToy`, `soundTransmog`

## How It Works

### Dropdown Population
- Dropdowns automatically populate with all sounds registered in LibSharedMedia
- This includes both NoobTacoUI-Media sounds and any sounds from other addons
- Available sounds from NoobTacoUI-Media:
  - `NT_InfussionOfLight` - Magical, ethereal sound
  - `NT_Chest` - Treasure chest opening
  - `NT_Mount` - Mount-related sound 
  - `NT_NPC` - NPC interaction sound
  - `NT_Group` - Social/group sound
  - `NT_Collection` - General collection sound

### Settings Persistence
- Changes are saved immediately when a dropdown selection is made
- Settings persist across WoW sessions and characters (account-wide)
- The CollectionNotifications module automatically uses the selected sounds

### UI Integration
- Dropdowns follow the Nord theme color scheme
- Hover effects and visual feedback match the existing design
- Test buttons provide immediate audio feedback
- Proper enable/disable state management when master toggle is off

## Usage Instructions

1. **Open the config menu**: `/ntconfig` or `/ntcc` (direct to notifications)
2. **Navigate to Audio > Collection Notifications**
3. **Select sounds**: Use the dropdowns next to each notification type
4. **Test sounds**: Click the play button (▶) next to each dropdown
5. **Settings auto-save**: No need to apply or save - changes are immediate

## Technical Details

### LibSharedMedia Integration
- Uses LSM to fetch all available sounds: `LSM:List("sound")`
- Sound playback via: `PlaySoundFile(LSM:Fetch("sound", soundName), "Master")`

### Custom Dropdown Implementation
- Built from scratch to match Nord theming
- Includes scroll functionality for long sound lists
- Click-outside-to-close behavior
- Proper z-indexing to appear above other UI elements

### Callback System
- Dropdown changes trigger `OnValueChanged` callbacks
- Settings changes propagate through `addon.CallbackRegistry`
- CollectionNotifications module receives updates automatically

## Available Commands

### Config Access
- `/ntconfig` - Main configuration menu
- `/ntuiconfig`, `/ntmedia`, `/ntuimedia` - Alternative config commands
- `/ntcc` - Direct access to Collection Notifications

### Testing Commands (from CollectionNotifications)
- `/ntmcollection test` - Test all notification sounds
- `/ntmcollection testpet` - Test pet notification
- `/ntmcollection testmount` - Test mount notification  
- `/ntmcollection testtoy` - Test toy notification
- `/ntmcollection testtransmog` - Test transmog notification
- `/ntmcollection status` - Show current settings

## Result

Users can now:
✅ Select any available sound for each notification type
✅ Preview sounds immediately with test buttons
✅ Have settings saved globally across all characters
✅ Choose from all LibSharedMedia-registered sounds (not just NoobTacoUI-Media sounds)
✅ Enjoy a seamless, Nord-themed user experience

The implementation provides a professional, user-friendly interface for customizing collection notification sounds while maintaining consistency with the existing NoobTacoUI aesthetic!
