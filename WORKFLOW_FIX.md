# GitHub Workflow Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed
The `package-test` job was trying to upload zip artifacts even when no zip files were created, causing the warning:
```
No files were found with the provided path: .release/*.zip. No artifacts will be uploaded.
```

## Root Cause
- Non-develop branches: Packager runs with `-z` flag (no zip creation)
- Develop branches: Packager creates zips but upload step could still fail
- Missing error handling for artifact upload

## Solutions Applied

### 1. CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
- **Split packaging logic**: Non-develop branches use `-z` (no zip), develop branches create zips
- **Added safety**: `if-no-files-found: warn` for graceful handling
- **Clear separation**: Different steps for different branch types

### 2. Dev Release Workflow (`dev-release.yml`)  
- **Added safety**: `if-no-files-found: error` since zips should always exist in manual releases

## Workflow Logic Now
```
Non-develop branches:
├── Run luacheck ✓
├── Test packaging (no zip) ✓  
└── Skip artifact upload ✓

Develop branches:
├── Run luacheck ✓
├── Create full package with zip ✓
└── Upload artifact (with error handling) ✓
```

## Expected Results
- ✅ No more "no files found" warnings
- ✅ Faster CI on non-develop branches (no zip creation)
- ✅ Proper artifacts on develop branches
- ✅ Clear error handling if something goes wrong
