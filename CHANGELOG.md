    - Avoid copying shell scripts and other unwanted files  
    - More targeted file selection for cleaner artifacts  
- NEW APPROACH: Copy artifacts immediately after packaging

    - This preserves files before any potential cleanup by the packager action  
    - Upload from ./artifacts/ instead of trying to access .release directly  
    - Should finally solve the 'No files were found' issue  
- Debug artifact upload issue and revert to directory upload  
    - Add current working directory and file listing to debug output

    - Remove problematic upload-artifact step that was failing  
    - Keep debug output to verify packaging and changelog work  
    - Focus on testing core functionality rather than artifact storage  
    - User can verify via workflow logs that everything works properly  
- fix(workflows): Use multi-line path specification for artifact upload  
- fix(workflows): Upload entire .release directory as artifact  
- debug: Add debug step to check release directory contents  
- fix(workflows): Simplify packager args for test builds
