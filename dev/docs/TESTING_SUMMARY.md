# General Settings Testing Summary

## Implementation Complete âœ…

The General Settings feature implementation is now complete and ready for cross-version testing. Here's what has been implemented and is ready to test:

## Features Ready for Testing

### 1. General Settings Panel
- **Location**: Main configuration menu â†’ "General Settings" in sidebar
- **Design**: Professional Nord-themed panel matching existing Audio Collection style
- **Content**: Minimap button toggle, Addon compartment toggle, comprehensive help text

### 2. Minimap Button Integration
- **Visual**: Custom button with NoobTacoUI-Media logo and Nord styling
- **Functionality**: Left-click opens configuration menu
- **Toggle**: Real-time show/hide via checkbox in General Settings
- **Persistence**: Setting saved in `NoobTacoUIMediaDB.GeneralSettings.showMinimapButton`

### 3. WoW Addon Compartment Integration  
- **Modern Integration**: Appears in WoW's addon drawer (retail only)
- **Functionality**: 
  - Left-click: Open configuration menu
  - Right-click: Toggle collection notifications
- **Toggle**: Enable/disable via checkbox in General Settings  
- **Smart Behavior**: When disabled, shows informative messages instead of functioning

## Testing Versions

### ðŸŽ¯ Primary Target: Retail (11.x)
- **Full Feature Set**: All features should work
- **Addon Compartment**: Should appear in addon drawer
- **Minimap Button**: Should work with full styling
- **Settings Persistence**: All settings should save/load properly

### ðŸ”„ Secondary Targets: Classic Versions
- **Classic Era (1.15.x)**: Minimap button only (no compartment)
- **Classic TBC/Wrath**: Minimap button only (no compartment)
- **Expected Behavior**: Graceful fallback, no errors

### Settings Persistence Testing
- [ ] All settings save immediately when changed

### Error Handling Testing

## Known Behaviors

### Expected Limitations
