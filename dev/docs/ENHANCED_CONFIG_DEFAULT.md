# NoobTacoUI-Media: Enhanced Config Now Default! 🌟

## What's Changed

### ✅ Enhanced Config (`/ntuiconfig2`) is now the DEFAULT
- `/ntconfig` → Now opens the enhanced version
- `/ntcc` → Collection notifications now uses enhanced version  
- Interface Options → Registers enhanced version with WoW's settings

### ✅ Multiple Ways to Access Enhanced Config
```
/ntconfig      - Main command (now enhanced)
/ntuiconfig2   - Direct access to enhanced  
/ntmedia       - Short alias for enhanced
/ntuimedia     - Alternative alias for enhanced
/ntcc          - Collection notifications (enhanced)
```

### ✅ Enhanced Visual Improvements Added
- **Decorative title underlines** with Nord accent colors
- **Version footer** in bottom-right corner
- **Better content dividers** and spacing
- **Professional polish** throughout

### ✅ Fallback System
If enhanced config fails to load, commands gracefully fall back to the original implementation.
